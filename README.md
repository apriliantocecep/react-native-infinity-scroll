# React Native Infinity Scroll

Built with latest expo. Currently SDK 28.0.0

## Up and Running

First you need to install node modules:
```
npm install
```

it will install all package in *package.json*

and because this made within expo XDE not with *```create-react-native-app```* command, you just start with command below for running on **android** or **ios**

```
exp ios
exp android
```

or you can open existing folder with expo XDE, than just run.

all you need is in [Expo Documentation](https://docs.expo.io/versions/v28.0.0/workflow/up-and-running)
